Hello welcome to the CustomBinLoader repository, this small tool, or rather a set of tools, allows you to run .bin files on 3ds systems with boot9strap ONLY BOOT9STRAP NOT FASTBOOT3DS this set is distributed with luma 7.0.5 included compatible with the latest version
yes but what can I do with this tool? Run two CFWs on the same console without any problems, two Luma, but also Reinand, RxTools, and so on
How can I start this "alternative system"? Power on by holding the D-pad down
Am I at risk with this tool? No, you don't risk any bricks by using this tool
Why are there files in the 3ds folder? This tool was created as a "bridge" to use Homebrew Hax2.x on a Luma 3DS boot9strap system if you don't want to delete the folder
How do I start a .bin file of my choice? CustomBinLoader can only start one bin at a time, so if you want to start your own bin, rename it to CustomBinLoader and put it in the root of the SD

THE FILES ARE NOT MINE, I USED THE LUMA REPOSITORY TO LUMA3DS https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases AND BOOTCTR AS A TOOL I JUST PACKAGE THE WHOLE THING AND MAKE IT EASIER
Thank you for your support
